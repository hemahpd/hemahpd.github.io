<h4>TIME COMPLEXITY TO BE KNOWN BY PROGRAMMERS</h4>
<p>It is the time when I am preparing for my placements on data structures and algorithms. I have come to understand the importance and need of time complexity for programming. All online coding platforms accept the code only if the code is optimised with the given time and space complexity. The time complexity plays an important role equivalent to programming logic.</p>

<p>So what <b>TIME COMPLEXITY</b> is?</p>
<p>In computer science, the time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm. Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform.</p>

<p>Big-O notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their running time or space requirements grow as the input size (n) grows. This notation characterizes functions according to their growth rates: different functions with the same growth rate may be represented using the same O notation.These are the most common time complexities expressed using the Big-O notation:</p>
