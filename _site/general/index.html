        <h3>Blog Zero - Making of this website</h3>
        <h6>By&nbsp;&nbsp;Hema&nbsp;&nbsp;on&nbsp;&nbsp;04 Jul 2020</h6>
        <p><h4>MAKING OF THIS WEBSITE</h4>
<p>Creating this website was a journey of trial and error, and experiential guessing. There are so many ways to go about creating a website now and its very easy to get lost in trying to pick the BEST option. As a beginner, I wanted to pick a platform or technology that I could get up and running relatively quickly, so I chose Jekyll, a static website generator for now as it had the possibility of foregoing a database,saving time and effort on the set up and configuration.</p>

<p>My previous website was setup with a Django backend but I didn't host it as I couldn't get the best out of it and was about to learn more about it. You can find the code for that <a href="https://github.com/hemahpd/personal-website-django">here</a>.</p>

<p>This website of mine is <del>probably</del> definitely overkill for a simple personal website, however it was a good opportunity to learn Jekyll in creating a personal website along with blog.At some point in the future I wanted to move my content to a dynamic website and retain control of how to setup the backend and take the opportunity to learn relevant industry skills. </p>

<p>Thanks for reading.ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
